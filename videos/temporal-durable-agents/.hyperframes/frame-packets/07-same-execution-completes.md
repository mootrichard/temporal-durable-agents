## Frame 7 — Same execution, verified result

- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/07-same-execution-completes.html
- duration: 6.187s
- poster: 5.4s
- transition_in: progress-carry
- type: benefit_highlight
- blueprint: video-text-pivot (Adapt)
- scene: The recovered product screen slides aside just enough to reveal three proof receipts: SAME WORKFLOW ID, 4/4 TESTS, 1-LINE DIFF.
- voiceover: "Same execution. Four tests green. One-line fix verified. No restart from zero."
- asset_candidates: .media/images/image_001.png
- narrativeRole: Cash the architecture into observable evidence and leave the audience with a compact completion receipt.
- focal: .media/images/image_001.png
- roles: .media/images/image_001.png = hero recovered product proof
- sfx: whoosh-short, notification

Use the real screenshot and diff, with no invented performance metric. Source: `README.md` lines 108–116 and `docs/talk-track.md` lines 60–67.

Adapt: keep the same-anchor weight-transfer signature; use the recovered product capture as a still product surface, then transfer its visual weight through three real proof receipts.

Scene 1 (0.0–1.3s): the recovered execution-tree capture establishes center-frame at full readable scale; `SAME EXECUTION` appears in the mono rail, with no stat cards yet.
Scene 2 (1.3–2.9s): the capture slides left and scales down on one long-tail move while `SAME WORKFLOW ID` takes the vacated right anchor (`scale-swap-transition`); both remain visible.
Scene 3 (2.9–4.2s): the ID receipt shifts upward and `4 / 4 TESTS` counts/fills beneath it (`stat-bars-and-fills`) as the VO says “Four tests green.”
Scene 4 (4.2–5.1s): `1-LINE DIFF` snaps into the lower right; the screenshot’s real diff region receives one restrained keyword glow.
Scene 5 (5.1–6.187s): all three receipts compress into one violet stamp: `NO RESTART FROM ZERO`; the product capture returns to visual parity and the full proof tableau holds.

## Selected blueprint: video-text-pivot

# video-text-pivot — Video → Text Pivot

**intent**: A product video holds center and claims attention, then slides aside to hand its weight to a hero stat in the space it vacates, then both clear and kinetic text types into the center — accent words carrying the meaning the video used to carry — sealed by a gradient pill. The arc is "show → yield → pivot → stamp," and each handoff pairs an exit with a same-anchor entrance so two beats read, not four.

**roles served**

- Product_Intro (from `metric-video-text-pivot`): when the open is "see the feature" then "see the impact" and the `[product video]` must stay visible through the stat reveal — it slides, it doesn't cut.
- Key_Feature: a feature clip that yields to a frame-filling metric and a typographic impact line.

**duration**: 6–8s

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas; one `[product video]` as a real muted `.mp4` clip, a hero stat, then kinetic text — each pair shares a screen anchor so the handoff reads as a weight-transfer)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.6s) — the video shows.** The `[product video]` lands centered on a smooth scale-up and breathes (a small y-bob), claiming full attention. Camera static.
- **Scene 2 (~1.6–3.2s) — yield + stat (signature move).** The video SLIDES aside (x + scale down) **into the very space** the `[hero stat]` now fills as the stat pops in with 3D-depth type — one weight-transfer reading as a single event, not two. The stat breathes within this window.
- **Scene 3 (~3.2–5.0s) — pivot to text.** Both video and stat clear out and kinetic `[impact text]` TYPES into the vacated center, character by character; its `[accent words]` carry the meaning the video used to carry.
- **Scene 4 (~5.0–end) — stamp.** A gradient `[pill]` snaps shut around the closing line (`scaleX` 0→1), its glow halo resolving a beat behind so the silhouette reads before the bloom — sealing the statement as one graphic. Holds.

**motion vocabulary**: video scale-in + small breath; weight-transfer slide (video x + scale-down handing off to the stat at the same anchor); 3D-depth stat type; character-stream typing; gradient pill scaleX-snap; glow-halo bloom trailing the silhouette.

**rule mapping**

- video entrance (smooth) and the weight-transfer slide → `gsap-effects` (scale/opacity then x + scale on a long-tail `power3`); the video itself is a muted `<video class="clip">` direct child of the root
- hero stat's frame-filling 3D type → `3d-text-depth-layers` (static-depth variation — layers built at setup, no cascade fighting the entry)
- the same-anchor video-exit ↔ stat-entry handoff (if treated as a morph) → `scale-swap-transition` (shared center)
- character-by-character impact typing through segmented spans → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (clean character stream) or `discrete-text-sequence`
- pill `scaleX` snap + trailing glow halo → `gsap-effects` (scaleX) + `ambient-glow-bloom` (the halo, resolving a beat behind)
- video / stat breath within their windows → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude register — subtle jitter, gated to each element's window, never a forever loop)

**camera modifier**: camera-static — all motion is element-space (the video translates), so the "pivot" is the elements moving, not a camera.

## Selected motion rule: scale-swap-transition

description: Coordinated shrink-out + spring pop-in morph-like transition between two elements — no SVG path interpolation needed.

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.

# Stat Bars & Fills

The graphics that give a stat **visual weight** beside its number: a small bar chart, a progress bar/ring filling to a percentage, or a star row filling to a fractional rating. Pair these with [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md) (the number) for a complete stat scene.

**Layout blueprint — pick ONE and hold it across all stats:**

- **Single-focus** — one centered frame, the number is the hero, a ring or bar sits under/around it. Cleanest for a sequential reveal (stat 1 → stat 2 → stat 3 in the same frame).
- **Split-frame** — big number on the left, paired graphic on the right. Better when stats are shown together or each needs a distinct visual.

Don't mix blueprints between stats in one piece — that reads as inconsistent.

## Recipe

### 1 — Growth Bars (CSS `scaleY` stagger)

Bars grow from the baseline with a stagger; the last bar is the accent. Heights are authored in CSS (inline height per bar); GSAP only reveals `scaleY: 0 → 1` — never animate `height`.

```css
.bars {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-end;
  gap: 14px;
  height: 280px;
}
.bar {
  width: 48px;
  background: #3a4a64;
  transform: scaleY(0);
  transform-origin: bottom center; /* grow UP from the baseline, not from center */
}
.bar:last-child {
  background: #ffc300; /* accent the final/current bar */
}
```

```js
tl.to(".bar", { scaleY: 1, duration: 0.7, ease: "power3.out", stagger: 0.08 }, 0.3);
```

### 2 — Progress Fill

**Bar form** — `scaleX` from a left origin:

```css
.track {
  width: 520px;
  height: 16px;
  background: #1b263b;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
/* width:100% is REQUIRED — an absolutely-positioned fill with no width is 0px, and scaleX of 0 is
   still 0 → the bar renders invisible (automated gates may miss a zero-width scaled element). */
.fill {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: #ffc300;
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: left center;
}
```

```js
const PCT = 0.92; // 92%
tl.to(".fill", { scaleX: PCT, duration: 1.0, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);
```

**Ring form** — measured stroke draw (mechanics in [svg-path-draw.md](svg-path-draw.md)):

```js
const ring = document.querySelector("#ring");
const LEN = ring.getTotalLength(); // measure, don't hard-code the circumference
ring.style.strokeDasharray = LEN;
ring.style.strokeDashoffset = LEN; // empty
// rotate the <circle> -90deg in CSS so the fill starts at 12 o'clock
tl.to(ring, { strokeDashoffset: LEN * (1 - 0.92), duration: 1.1, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);
```

### 3 — Star-Rating Fill (fractional)

A gold star row revealed left-to-right to a fractional value (e.g. 4.6 / 5) via a clip wipe over a gold layer sitting on a gray layer.

```html
<div class="stars">
  <div class="stars-gray">★★★★★</div>
  <div class="stars-gold" id="goldStars">★★★★★</div>
</div>
```

```css
.stars {
  position: relative;
  font-size: 64px;
  letter-spacing: 8px;
}
.stars-gray {
  color: #2b3548;
}
.stars-gold {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  color: #ffc300;
  width: 100%;
  clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0);
}
```

```js
const RATING = 4.6,
  MAX = 5;
tl.to(
  "#goldStars",
  { clipPath: `inset(0 ${100 - (RATING / MAX) * 100}% 0 0)`, duration: 1.0, ease: "power2.out" },
  0.3,
);
```

| ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bar count     | 4–6         | reads as "a trend" without clutter; the last bar is the current/accent value        |
| fill duration | 0.8–1.2s    | matched to the paired count-up so number and graphic land together (share the ease) |
| stagger       | 0.06–0.1s   | larger feels sluggish, 0 loses the build                                            |
| accent hue    | exactly one | bars/fill/stars all use the same accent, the rest is muted                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`scaleY` / `scaleX` / `clipPath`, never `height`/`width` tweens** — author each bar's final height in CSS and scale from 0.
- **`transform-origin`** must be `bottom` (bars grow up) / `left` (fills grow right) — the default center origin scales from the middle and looks wrong.
- **`.fill` needs `width: 100%`** — a zero-width fill scaled by any factor is still invisible, and automated gates may miss it.
- **Measure, don't hard-code** — ring length via `getTotalLength()`; a hard-coded circumference breaks if the radius changes.
- **Match the number's timing** — the fill and the count-up peak together (same start + ease) so the stat resolves as one beat, not two; a paired counter's `onUpdate` must be O(1) (see [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md)).
- **One accent hue, consistent blueprint** — see `hyperframes-creative/references/data-in-motion.md`.
