Scene 1 (0.0–2.0s): open 6× tight on one real thread receipt; a selection highlight steps through `planning` and `delegation` while the camera holds, using a rule-of-thirds macro with the product pixels as the full frame.
Scene 2 (2.0–3.3s): adjacent receipts for tools and tests reveal in the same close-up as the VO names them; no containing chrome is visible yet.
Scene 3 (3.3–4.4s): perform the blueprint’s single decelerating zoom-out (`viewport-change`) to reveal the whole four-pane agent workspace; camera locks at scale 1 and never moves again.
Scene 4 (4.4–6.0s): the wide console simplifies in place into coordinator, two investigator, and test-runner nodes; connector paths self-draw (`svg-path-draw`) as `planning · delegation · tools · tests` appear on their spoken cues.
Scene 5 (6.0–8.533s): `TEMPORAL MAKES THE TREE DURABLE` seats as a violet evidence rail beneath the locked wide; the real panes remain visible behind the diagram and hold.

## Selected blueprint: zoom-out-workspace-reveal

# zoom-out-workspace-reveal — Zoom-Out Workspace Reveal

**intent**: Open TIGHT on one full-bleed detail — a graphic macro or a small UI region — let micro-action play in close-up, then ONE continuous decelerating zoom-out reveals that everything seen so far lives inside a containing whole (a design-tool workspace / a multi-pane agent workspace); the frame locks at the wide and element-level payoff carries on. The zoom-out IS the narrative engine and the reveal-of-nesting is the payoff — distinct from `grid-card-assemble`, where a zoom-OUT is an optional camera modifier garnishing an element-stagger assemble; here nothing assembles, the world was whole all along, and the single outward move is what re-scopes its meaning. The structural inverse of every existing push-in shape (`constellation-hub`'s push-in, `device-surface-showcase`'s continuous push, `dataviz-countup`'s push-through).

**roles served**

- Hook (from `continuous-zoomout-nesting-reveal`): when the open should be a full-bleed graphic mystery — a blob morphing, a macro blossom blooming — resolved by one unbroken exponentially-decelerating zoom-out that passes THROUGH an intermediate composition (oversized headline / card artwork / web page) before revealing the whole thing is an artboard inside a design tool (panels, layers, inspector, timeline); the frame locks and the canvas keeps animating, ending mid-action.
- Benefits (from `close-up-open-single-zoom-out-reveal`): when the payoff is scale/breadth — micro-actions play in extreme close-up on one small UI region (file rows popping in, a highlight stepping, a guided glide down a list), then ONE fast smoothly-decelerating zoom-out (~0.5–1s) reveals the region was a corner of a huge multi-pane agent workspace (chat + artifact preview + sidebar); the wide holds static to the end while element-level payoff completes the story ("look how much the agent did — and here's the deliverable").

**duration**: 6.8–11s (Hook continuous-pull both 6.8s; Benefits dwell-then-snap 10.7–11s — the dwell and the post-lock payoff stretch, the reveal itself does not)

**HARD RULE — no zoom-in anywhere; camera static outside the single reveal.** Carried verbatim from both Benefits goldens and structurally true of both Hook goldens: the camera's only scale motion is OUTWARD. One zoom-out per shot. Before the reveal the camera either holds, glides/pans along the close-up surface, or is already running the (only) pull-back; after the reveal decelerates to a full stop the frame is LOCKED — every later change (pane swap, pane expansion, cursor travel, playhead scrub, canvas animation) is element/layout motion, never camera. No push-in, no punch, no re-zoom, no second reveal. Violating this collapses the shape back into a generic camera tour.

**shot structure** (one oversized static world — the full `[whole: workspace]` authored at final layout from frame 0 — with the camera starting scaled far in on the `[detail]`; the reveal is one scale animation on the world; two folded sub-shapes — **(A) continuous nesting pull** (Hook) and **(B) close-up dwell → snap reveal** (Benefits))

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~2.5s) — full-bleed detail + micro-action.** Extreme close-up: the `[detail: graphic macro — blob / blossom stem / small UI region — file list / browser corner]` fills the frame edge-to-edge with NO containing chrome, canvas, or neighboring panes visible. The detail PERFORMS in close-up — this beat is never a static hold:
  - _Variant — Hook (A)_: the graphic itself moves/morphs/blooms — an organic `[accent]` blob flows across and morphs into an undulating wavy line, or blurred macro forms sharpen as circular petals pop and expand outward into a flat vector `[motif]` — while the pull-back is ALREADY running underneath (the camera never waits).
  - _Variant — Benefits (B)_: camera holds (or glides) while UI micro-action plays — `[rows: filenames / list items]` pop in top-to-bottom, a soft `[highlight]` steps down row-by-row, or the camera rides down a list while gently pulling back. Optional blur-to-sharp resolve on the opening frame.

- **Scene 2 (~2.5s–reveal start) — the middle beat.** Diverges by sub-shape:
  - _Variant — Hook (A) — intermediate nesting level_: the continuing zoom-out resolves a mid-level composition, still full-bleed, still no chrome — oversized `[headline]` glyphs descend into frame as partial letterforms and settle centered (the "descent" is pure world-scale: the letters are static in world space, the camera pull produces the motion), or the `[motif]` is revealed living inside a `[card]` in a row of cards on a `[web page]`. The viewer re-scopes once — and still doesn't know the real container.
  - _Variant — Benefits (B) — close-up beat advances_: the close-up story develops at the same tightness — the view shifts to an adjacent `[panel]`, a new `[row]` fades/slides in and grows its panel, a `[cursor]` enters and hovers it with a soft highlight. This is the pre-reveal dwell; tension is "we're deep inside something."

- **Scene 3 (the reveal) — ONE decelerating zoom-out completes; frame LOCKS.** The signature move. The camera pulls back to scale 1 and eases to a full stop, revealing the containing `[whole]`:
  - _Variant — Hook (A)_: the pull is the tail of the SAME continuous zoom running since frame 0 (total travel ~4.3–4.5s of a 6.8s shot), with strong exponential deceleration — the `[intermediate composition]` turns out to be `[an artboard / a phone-screen mock]` on a `[design-tool canvas]`: light chrome, left pages/layers panel, right properties inspector, blue selection box, bottom animation timeline with keyframe bars.
  - _Variant — Benefits (B)_: the pull is a discrete rapid burst (~0.5–1s) from the held close-up — smooth, heavily decelerating — landing the full `[multi-pane agent workspace]`: left `[chat pane]` with the prompt + status + response, center/right `[artifact pane: spreadsheet / deck preview]`, optional `[sidebar: progress checklist + artifacts + context]`.
  - Both: the zoom-out ends BEFORE the shot does — always leave a post-lock act. The deceleration-to-stop is what makes the lock legible.

- **Scene 4 (lock–end) — element-level payoff on the locked wide.** The reveal is not the ending; the close-up's world keeps living inside the wide. All motion is element/layout:
  - _Variant — Hook (A)_: a `[cursor]` enters from off-frame and glides to hover/click the selected element, or a `[playhead]` scrubs left-to-right across the bottom timeline while the canvas artwork animates in sync (petals rotate about their hub, a starburst spins in place, a motif sweeps/shifts). Ends MID-ACTION — the tool is alive.
  - _Variant — Benefits (B)_: a `[file-attachment card]` fades in → the cursor clicks `[Open]` → the artifact pane swaps content via a quick white-out → the viewer pane expands full-width over its neighbor (LAYOUT motion, not camera) landing on the `[deliverable: full slide / dashboard]`; or the frame simply holds long and static while the cursor drifts to rest near the `[payoff stat]`. Struck-through checklist items in the sidebar read as completed work. Long hold to the end.

**motion vocabulary**: one continuous scale-driven zoom-out with exponential/eased deceleration (no cuts) · single fast decelerating zoom-out burst (~0.5–1s) · workspace-lock at zoom end · full-bleed no-chrome opening · blur-to-sharp macro focus resolve · organic blob flow + morph into undulating wavy line · squiggle-underline settle with residual undulation · circular petals popping/expanding outward (bloom) · oversized letters descending into frame as partial glyphs (world-scale, not element motion) · text scaling down through the frame to a centered settle · rows pop in top-to-bottom · selection highlight steps down row-by-row · camera rides/pans down a list while pulling back · new row fades/slides in and grows its panel · cursor hover with soft row highlight · cursor entering from off-frame and gliding to hover/click · timeline playhead scrub left-to-right · in-canvas rotation about a hub / spin-in-place · motif shift/sweep-in · file-attachment card fade-in · cursor click · pane content swap via quick white-out · pane expands full-width over neighbor (layout motion) · checklist items shown struck-through · long static hold · cursor drift to rest · ends mid-action (Hook).

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rule-id`)

- the single decelerating zoom-out on the whole world → `viewport-change` (one `.world` wrapper; `cam` object as single source of truth via `onUpdate`; start `cam.scale` at the reveal ratio with `T = -offset × S` centering the detail, tween scale → 1 and translate → 0 with ONE shared ease — the detail drifts from frame-center to its home slot as the wide takes over, exactly the golden read)
- off-center detail framed at open, zoom-out to wide → `coordinate-target-zoom` ("Zoom out (target → wide view)" variation — nested wrappers, reverse phases: start zoomed on the measured target, tween outer scale → 1 + inner translate → 0 with shared duration/ease; measure the detail's center after `fonts.ready`, never hand-derive)
- pre-reveal glide/ride down a list while gently pulling back (Benefits B) → `viewport-change` (pan + scale composed on the one `cam` object) — sequencing the slow-glide → hold → fast-pull profile → `multi-phase-camera` (phase machinery; this shape runs the same scale-agnostic math at 4–12× outward — see `viewport-change`'s scale-guide range note)
- exponential deceleration-to-stop → ease selection (`expo.out` / `power4.out` on the reveal tween) — parameter guidance, no rule needed; after the stop, NO camera tweens exist on the timeline (hard rule above)
- blur-to-sharp macro resolve chorded to the early pull → `depth-of-field-blur` (refocus/settle variation: `--dof` ramps to 0 as the zoom recedes, same timeline position as the pull)
- oversized partial glyphs descending / text scaling down through the frame → no element tween — authored static in world space; `viewport-change`'s pull produces the motion (author trap: animating the letters separately double-moves them)
- organic blob flow + morph into wavy line → SVG path morph — see `hyperframes-keyframes` (morph); flagged special, like `device-surface-showcase`'s WebGL specials — substitute a non-morph accent when the capability isn't loaded
- squiggle-underline residual undulation → `sine-wave-loop` (finite bounded undulation)
- circular petals pop/expand outward (bloom) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered pops) + `center-outward-expansion` (petals expand from the hub to final positions)
- rows pop in top-to-bottom → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group, ≤500ms stagger cap) or `gsap-effects` (low-drama fade + short slide stagger)
- selection highlight steps down row-by-row → `gsap-effects` (stepped `tl.set` repositions at time thresholds — instant steps, no glide; trivial, no dedicated rule needed)
- new row fades/slides in → `spring-pop-entrance` (soft variant); its panel growing to fit → `anchored-layout-expand` (one-axis layout expansion)
- cursor enters off-frame → glides → hovers → clicks → `cursor-click-ripple` (move-to-target, co-depress, ripple); soft hover row-highlight → `gsap-effects` (background-color/opacity tween)
- timeline playhead scrub left-to-right → `gsap-effects` (linear `ease:"none"` translateX); in-sync canvas animation = place the artwork tweens at the same timeline position as the scrub (sync is free on one paused timeline)
- in-canvas rotation about a hub / spin-in-place (petal flower, starburst) → `svg-icon-enrichment` (SVG `setAttribute('transform','rotate(deg cx cy)')` for explicit centers)
- motif shift/sweep-in on a card → `gsap-effects` (masked translate) or `techniques.md` clip-path reveal
- file-attachment card fade-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (soft) / `gsap-effects` fade
- pane content swap via quick white-out → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state swap at a threshold) + `gsap-effects` (white flash overlay with attack-decay opacity envelope)
- pane expands full-width over neighbor (layout motion) → `anchored-layout-expand` (one-axis layout hand-off; width/height tweens stay forbidden)
- checklist items struck-through / status states → static content, or `discrete-text-sequence` if they check off on screen
- long static hold + cursor drift to rest → hold needs no rule; the drift is a single slow `gsap-effects` translate that ARRIVES somewhere meaningful (rests near the payoff stat) — it performs, it is not idle wobble
- ends mid-action (Hook) → the playhead/canvas tweens simply run to the composition edge — no exit move, no rule

**camera law — staging the one move** (the camera is the engine here, not a modifier)

- Build the ENTIRE `[whole]` workspace at final layout inside one `.world` wrapper; there is no second set. The open is `cam.scale = S0` (typically 4–12× — whatever makes the `[detail]` full-bleed) with counter-translate centering the detail; the reveal tweens to `scale 1, translate 0`. `overflow: hidden` on the scene; background on the scene, never the world.
- Crispness constraint: everything visible at open must survive S0 magnification — author the detail as DOM/vector (text, SVG, CSS shapes); any raster inside the close-up needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S0`.
- Sub-shape A: the reveal tween spans ~0–4.5s with `expo.out`-class deceleration — one tween, no phases, no cuts; element beats (morph, bloom, glyph settle) are positioned along it.
- Sub-shape B: optional gentle pre-reveal pan/pull (`viewport-change` pan, or a slow scale ease-out ≤ ~15% travel) during the dwell, then the reveal burst (~0.5–1s, heavy decel) as its own tween; camera fully static after.
- Never: a zoom-in, a second zoom-out, camera motion after the lock, or replacing the reveal with a cut. One outward move is the whole grammar.

**boundary vs `grid-card-assemble`**: it already carries an optional zoom-OUT reveal modifier (glass-card / logo-wall variants), so the two shapes border each other. The test: if elements ASSEMBLE and the pull-back merely shows the assembled array in context, it's `grid-card-assemble`; if the world is whole from frame 0 and the single decelerating pull-back is itself the story — close-up mystery → nesting reveal → locked-frame payoff — it's this blueprint. Related evidence: a mined profile-page golden runs the same single UI zoom-out/scroll-up reveal at small scale inside a kinetic-type shot, corroborating the move's currency without sharing the shape.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |

| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.

description: Virtual camera — simulate zoom / pan / focus-lock by transforming a wrapper around all scene content. Camera moves right → world translates left.

# Viewport Change (Virtual Camera)

Simulates camera effects (zoom / pan / focus-lock on a moving element) by transforming a wrapper around ALL scene content. The "world" moves opposite to the perceived camera. Distinct from [multi-phase-camera](multi-phase-camera.md) (2-3 discrete phases + drift) — viewport-change is a single continuous zoom/pan, often used for focus-lock following a moving element.

## How It Works

Camera intent → world transform. Camera **pans right** → world `translateX(-distance)`; camera **zooms in** → world `scale(>1)`; camera **follows element X** → world `translateX(viewportCenter - elementWorldX)` per-frame. Get the sign right or everything moves the wrong way. The single `.world` wrapper holds the camera transform; elements inside are positioned in world space, unchanged.

**Single-element composite transform (this rule's form).** Both scale and translate live on ONE wrapper as `translate(x, y) scale(S)`. CSS applies scale FIRST, then translate (right-to-left matrix composition), so a point at world offset `(ox, oy)` lands on screen at `(S × ox + x, S × oy + y)`. To map the target to viewport center, solve `S × offset + T = 0`:

```
T = -offset × S
```

This is **different from [coordinate-target-zoom](coordinate-target-zoom.md)**, which uses two nested wrappers (outer scales, inner translates) and derives `T = -offset` (independent of S). Mixing up the two forms drifts the target off-center as scale changes. Use this single-wrapper form when you want one source of truth for camera state (`cam.scale`, `cam.x`, `cam.y`) written via `onUpdate`; use nested wrappers when scale and translate can tween independently with shared ease.

  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* centered scaling is what the math assumes */

}
```

```js
const world = document.getElementById("world");

// Camera state — single source of truth. The world transform is composed from
// this object in ONE place so the transform string order is stable.
const cam = { scale: 1, x: 0, y: 0 };
function applyCamera() {
  world.style.transform = `translate(${cam.x}px, ${cam.y}px) scale(${cam.scale})`;
}
applyCamera(); // seed frame 0

// Zoom in on the CTA: single-element composite transform → T = -offset × S.
// TARGET_OFFSET_Y is the target's measured offset from viewport center at
// neutral camera (sign matters — positive = below center).
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y * TARGET_SCALE;

## Scale Value Guide

| Effect      | Scale       | Feel                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Subtle      | 1.02 - 1.05 | Barely perceptible — "professional" |
| Medium      | 1.05 - 1.15 | "Ta-da" emphasis                    |
| Noticeable  | 1.15 - 1.30 | Focus on region                     |
| Dramatic    | 1.5 - 2.5   | Element fills screen                |
| Full-screen | 3.0+        | Element covers viewport             |

Perception: < 5% scale change is imperceptible; 10-15% is comfortable emphasis; > 30% is cinematic/dramatic. For a natural product feel, prefer 1.05-1.15× over 2-3s; save big > 1.3× zooms for dramatic narrative moments.

### Extreme range — 4–12× outward (workspace reveal)

The same single-cam math runs far past the table: a zoom-out workspace reveal opens punched-in at **4–12×** on one detail (a single cell, message, or button) and pulls out to the full workspace in one continuous move. The mechanics don't change — one `cam` object, `T = -offset × S`, one `applyCamera()` writer — only the authoring direction does:

- **Build the workspace at its final (1×) layout and OPEN scaled-in** (`cam.scale = 8`, counter-translate aiming the opening detail; state it in a `fromTo` / seed via `applyCamera()` so a seek to t=0 lands punched-in). The wide landing frame is then everything at native design size — text crisp, raster assets at source resolution.
- **Never the inverse** — authoring the close-up at 1× and scaling the world down to 0.08–0.25 for the wide frame drops every label below legible pixel size and softens raster media; the reveal lands on mush.
- **Measure the opening target** — at S = 8, a 1 px error in the baked offset is 8 px on screen at the opening pose. Take the offset from the target's real laid-out center (`getBoundingClientRect` after `fonts.ready`, once at setup — the measuring doctrine in [coordinate-target-zoom.md](coordinate-target-zoom.md)), never from a layout formula.
- **The opening detail must survive ×S** — it renders at `S ×` its design size on the first frames (vector/DOM text is safe; raster needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S`).

## Variations

- **Focus-lock (camera follows a moving cursor/character)** — keep the element at a fixed screen X by computing the world offset per-frame inside the driver's `onUpdate`:

```js
const focusEl = document.querySelector(".moving-cursor");
const targetScreenX = VIEWPORT_WIDTH * FOCUS_SCREEN_X_FRAC; // 0.4–0.7; 0.5 = dead center
const focusUpdate = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  focusUpdate,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: FOLLOW_DUR, // matches how long the focused element is in motion
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const rect = focusEl.getBoundingClientRect();
      cam.x = targetScreenX - (rect.left + rect.width / 2);
      applyCamera();
    },
  },
  FOLLOW_START,
);
```

- **Composite scale (multi-phase)** — two proxy tweens multiplied through one writer: `cam.scale = scaleUp.v * scaleDown.v; applyCamera()`. Combine a slow push-in (~1.15) with a brief release (~0.9) for a breath/punch shape.
- **Camera mode transition (centered → follow)** — crossfade two camera modes via a 0→1 weight tween; intermediate frames interpolate between the modes' offsets.

## Critical Constraints

- **One `.world` wrapper carries the whole camera** — every scene element lives inside it; a second transformed wrapper is a second camera.
- **Single source of truth via the `cam` object + `applyCamera()`** — when scale and translate both change, write them in ONE place; never split them across tweens that touch `world.style.transform` directly (the transform string composition order becomes unpredictable).
- **Single-wrapper counter-translate is `T = -offset × S`** — don't import the nested-wrapper `T = -offset` formula.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`**; **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.world`**; **background on `.scene`, never on `.world`**.
